      any tracks to the New Stations entry to create a pre-seeded station.
    * Added auto-completion for artists while filling in a station or automatic
      playlist.

      as a node under the Super Collection.
    * Fix massive speed bottleneck on startup in the case of many recently
      played playlists.

    * Fixed issue where automatic playlists and station summaries were not
      updated in the playlist header.

    * Revert change introduced in 0.0.2 causing Twitter protocol to not try
      to reconnect to a peer if it couldn't connect the first time the plugin
      was connected. This caused confusing (and for most unwanted) behavior.
    * Fix crashes in Twitter authentication.
    * Properly honor the chosen port number if a static host and port are
      marked as preferred.

      the Tomahawk XMPP presence.
